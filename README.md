Research IT Workshops
=============================
A proposed set of workshops for ISU Researchers challenged with high-end Research IT needs.
---------------------------------------------------

**Caveats:**

- Researchers are potentially; faculty, staff, post-docs, graduate students, undergrads involved in research.
- HPC is High Performance Computing. This implies speed, not any particular architecture.
- Researchers have needs for both parallel and serial processing.

**Strategies:**

- Digestable size - short 2-3hrs. maximum
- Free (Maybe even provide food)
- Regular - offered as often as needed
- Deliver a product/concept/tool that can be immediately implemented in the researchers development workflow
- Supporting documentation freely available
- Encourage self guided and peer-to-peer learning
- Live demonstrations with all the flaws - *No Hand Waving*
- Open Source
- Open Access

**Workshop/Concept Titles**

- Linux: Basics
	- Taught: once a semester
	- A laptop with ssh provided or bring your own.
	- Isilon storage has to be requested and approved in advance
	- default shell changed to bash prior to workshop

- Linux: Command line Deep Dive
	- Taught: once a month as an open workshop
	- A laptop with ssh provided by BIT or bring your own.
	- A sandbox supplied by BIT
	- default shell changed to Bash prior to workshop

- Linux: String Manipulation
	- grep, sed, awk

- Linux: Job Management
	- Logs
	- Checkpoints
	- Performance troubleshooting / tuning

- Machine Resources & Software Development Best Practices
	- HPC Architectures
	- How to identify the right place to run your computation
	- Bottleneck types
	- Documentation methods
	- Testing and debugging
	- From raw data to graph, programmatically

- Data & Code Management
	- Taught: once a month as an open workshop
	- Directory Structure
	- Data Workflows
	- Workgroup collaboration tools 
	- A GitHub repository cloned locally
	- A BitBucket repository cloned locally


-Possible future topics
	- Jump into Python

	- Jump start into BigRam, BioCrunch, BIT resources
	- Serial processing
	- Parallel processing
	- Accelerators
	- Regular Open Workshop Time
	- Databases and SQL
		- Taught: once a month as an open workshop
