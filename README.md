**Caveats:**

- Researchers are potentially faculty, staff, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students but generally not undergraduates.
- HPC is High Performance Computing. This implies speed, not any particular architecture.
- Researchers have needs for both parallel and serial processing.

**Strategies:**

- Digestable size - short 2-3hrs. maximum
- Free (Maybe even provide food)
- Regular - offered as often as needed
- Deliver a product/concept/tool that can be immediately implemented in the researchers development workflow
- Supporting documentation freely available
- Encourage self guided and peer-to-peer learning
- Live demonstrations with all the flaws - *No Hand Waving*
- Open Source
- Open Access

**Workshop/Concept Titles**

- SSH
- Unix Shell
- Shell Scripting
- Version Control with GIT
